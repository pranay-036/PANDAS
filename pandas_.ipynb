        "1. **Data Cleaning in Financial Analysis**\n",
        "* **Scenario** : A financial analyst receives a dataset of stock prices with missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.\n",
        "* **Pandas Solution** : They can use Pandas to:\n",
        " * **Identify and handle missing values:** df.isnull().sum() to detect missing values, and methods like df.fillna() to fill them with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median).\n",
        " * **Correct data types:** Use df.astype() to convert columns to the correct data type (e.g., convert a price column from string to float).\n",
        " * **Remove or adjust outliers:** Use visualization techniques like box plots to identify outliers, and then filter or transform the data accordingly.\n",
        "2. **EDA in Customer Analytics**\n",
        "* **Scenario:** A marketing team wants to understand customer behavior from a dataset of customer purchases, demographics, and website interactions.\n",
        "* **Pandas Solution**\n",
        " * **Data exploration:** Use df.describe() to get summary statistics, df.groupby() to analyze data by customer segments, and df.corr() to find correlations between variables (e.g., purchase frequency and age).\n",
        " * **Data visualization:** Create histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations using Pandas plotting functions or integrate with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights from the data.\n",
        " * **Feature engineering:** Create new features from existing ones, such as calculating customer lifetime value or segmenting customers based on purchase behavior.\n",
        "* **3.Data Cleaning in Healthcare:**\n",
        " * **Scenario:** A healthcare researcher has a dataset of patient records with inconsistencies in data entry, missing values, and duplicate entries.\n",
        " * **Pandas Solution:**\n",
        "   * **Standardize data:** Use string functions (df['name'].str.lower()) to clean and standardize text data (e.g., patient names, diagnoses).\n",
        "   * **Identify and remove duplicates:** Use df.duplicated() and df.drop_duplicates() to find and remove duplicate patient records.\n",
        "   * **Handle missing data:** Use various imputation techniques available in Pandas to fill missing values based on the nature of the data.\n",
        "These examples illustrate how Pandas simplifies common data cleaning and EDA tasks, enabling data professionals to prepare and analyze data effectively."
